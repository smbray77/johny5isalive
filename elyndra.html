        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>Elyndra was a child of the streets when the meteor struck, destroying her town and taking her family. Despite losing everything, she was found by an elder of the Church of Healing Light, who witnessed her trying to help and heal others in the aftermath of the catastrophe. Recognizing her natural compassion, the elder took her in, and Elyndra began her lifelong training in the church.</p>
        <p>The church’s teachings instilled a deep faith in her abilities and her purpose, but she struggles to reconcile her deity’s silence on the origin and nature of the Unknown Monsters. She has come to rationalize them as demons her teachings simply never mentioned, though this belief leaves her unsettled.</p>
        <p>Her greatest internal battle lies in her survivor’s guilt. She carries the weight of feeling unable to save her family during the meteor strike, compounded by the recent loss of her adventuring party. Despite her reputation as the best healer in the realm, these unresolved feelings often haunt her.</p>
