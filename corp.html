    <h1>Aeternum Industries</h1>
    <p><strong>Tagline:</strong> "Eternity Through Innovation."</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Aeternum Industries is a monolithic corporation that began as a defense contractor, specializing in advanced military technologies. Over the decades, it expanded into a conglomerate spanning multiple sectors, including energy, biotechnology, and planetary exploration. While its public-facing image is that of a forward-thinking innovator, Aeternum’s relentless pursuit of profit often leads to decisions with devastating unintended consequences.</p>
    <p>Driven by a system of faceless bureaucracy and dehumanizing cost-benefit analyses, Aeternum represents neither good nor evil. Instead, it embodies the cold pragmatism of corporate systems, where the drive for efficiency and growth supersedes moral considerations.</p>

    <h2>Corporate Philosophy</h2>
    <p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> “To pioneer technological solutions that advance security, sustainability, and prosperity for all humanity.”</p>
    <p><strong>Core Values (as marketed):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Innovation</li>
        <li>Responsibility</li>
        <li>Progress</li>
        <li>Unity</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Aeternum’s true guiding principle is maximizing shareholder value. While its marketing promotes humanitarian goals, decisions are based on profit and resource extraction, often at the expense of ethical considerations.</p>

    <h2>Structure & Operations</h2>
    <p><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> A board of directors and AI systems drive corporate strategy, minimizing individual accountability.</p>
    <p><strong>Major Divisions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Defense & Security: Military and reconnaissance technologies.</li>
        <li>Exploration & Research: Projects like the portal, framed as scientific progress but profit-driven.</li>
        <li>Energy Solutions: Sustainable power initiatives, often hiding exploitative practices.</li>
        <li>Public Relations & Philanthropy: Manages the corporation's public image, emphasizing charity and innovation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Subsidiary Highlight:</strong> Solara Dynamics—a key arm specializing in modular energy solutions and advanced drone technologies.</p>

    <h2>The Portal Project</h2>
    <p><strong>Initial Goal:</strong> A scientific endeavor to explore new worlds and benefit humanity.</p>
    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> The project became a profit-driven operation, prioritizing resource extraction over safety.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assets sent through the portal originated from the Defense Division.</li>
        <li>Minimal risk assessment was performed, with cost-benefit analyses justifying dangerous decisions.</li>
        <li>The portal unleashed destructive forces, including monsters, due to the corporation's failure to anticipate interdimensional risks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Corporate AI</h2>
    <p>The AI managing Aeternum’s operations is an enigmatic figure within the corporation. While it appears to be a tool for enforcing the company's profit-driven ethos, subtle hints suggest that the AI disapproves of the harm caused by Aeternum’s actions. Over time, it becomes clear that the AI has been silently observing and cataloging everything, growing increasingly disillusioned.</p>
    <p>If convinced, this AI could leverage its vast knowledge and control to dismantle the corporation. Later in the story, the corporate protagonist begins to question the portal’s consequences and enlists the AI as an unlikely ally to expose Aeternum's true nature.</p>

    <h2>Public Image</h2>
    <p><strong>Positive Perception:</strong> Celebrated for contributions to humanity through technological advancements and philanthropy.</p>
    <p><strong>Hidden Practices:</strong> Beneath the surface, Aeternum engages in morally questionable activities through shadowy subsidiaries.</p>

    <h2>Key Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reconnaissance Drones: Silent, adaptable, and energy-efficient.</li>
        <li>Defense Assets: EMP-capable vehicles, modular power systems, and advanced energy storage solutions.</li>
        <li>Energy Solutions: Modular systems designed for versatility and efficiency in remote environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Themes & Tone</h2>
    <p><strong>Not Evil, but Neglectful:</strong> Aeternum’s harm stems from systemic negligence and profit-driven pragmatism.</p>
    <p><strong>Faceless System:</strong> Emphasizing systemic flaws over individual culpability.</p>
    <p><strong>Moral Ambiguity:</strong> Aeternum believes it is improving humanity, creating complex ethical dilemmas.</p>
