        <h2>Background</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Humble Beginnings:</strong> 
                Casey grew up in a small industrial town with a mechanic father and teacher mother. She developed her technical curiosity and work ethic by helping her father repair machinery and absorbing her mother’s love of problem-solving.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Education and Early Struggles:</strong> 
                While excelling in practical, hands-on engineering work, Casey struggled with theory-heavy courses in college. She worked multiple jobs to pay for her education, balancing shifts at a factory with her studies. Despite these challenges, she earned a reputation for her innovative solutions and calm demeanor under pressure.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Connection with Elias:</strong> 
                Casey met Elias in their first year of college, and they quickly bonded over shared frustrations with academic bureaucracy and a mutual passion for innovation. While Elias dreamed big, Casey grounded their projects in reality, creating a dynamic that defined their friendship.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Career at Aeternum Industries:</strong> 
                After graduation, Casey joined Aeternum Industries as a junior engineer. Known for her practical problem-solving and integrity, she became the person colleagues turned to for reliable fixes. She clashed with corporate leadership at times, refusing to cut corners or compromise her values, but her contributions were quietly pivotal to many major projects.

                Casey designed the AI protagonist (nicknamed Sunny after her grandmother) as a personal project, reflecting her values of resourcefulness and adaptability. Unknown to her, Sunny’s unique power source and neural subroutines allow it to evolve beyond its original programming.
