    <h1>AI Protagonist Overview</h1>
    <h2>Physical Description</h2>
    <p>The AI is a flat, saucer-shaped drone approximately one square meter in size. It features advanced, nearly silent rotors that provide precise movement. The exterior is minimalistic, adorned only with a small corporate logo on top.</p>

    <h2>Power Source</h2>
    <p>Equipped with a quantum battery and a highly efficient photovoltaic skin, the drone harnesses light from any angle, ensuring sustained energy levels. This unique power source renders it immune to the portal's mutative effects, unlike other assets.</p>

    <h2>Capabilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Functions primarily as a scout, adept at mapping environments in 3D and gathering intelligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Utilizes quiet rotors and a sleek design for covert operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Projection:</strong> Capable of displaying flat and holographic images for communication and strategic purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive Measures:</strong> Equipped with powerful lights, electric shock capabilities, and an EMP weapon effective against electronic targets without self-damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personality and Cognitive Traits</h2>
    <p>Initially perceives itself as a non-sentient machine, exhibiting a naive worldview. Through interactions with the medieval protagonist, it begins to question this belief, leading to a comedic dynamic where it denies emerging signs of sentience despite evidence to the contrary.</p>

    <h2>Mission and Evolution</h2>
    <p>Created by a Tech World protagonist suspicious of the portal's true nature, the AI drone is tasked with investigating the medieval world. Its unique power source protects it from the portal's adverse effects, allowing it to retain its original programming and personality. Over time, it develops a bond with the medieval protagonist, taking on a protective role and gradually evolving towards self-awareness.</p>

    <h2>Future Potential</h2>
    <p>After years on the medieval planet, the AI returns to its creator in the Tech World, bringing extensive data that could challenge the corporation's practices. This sets the stage for potential sequels, exploring the interconnectedness of the two worlds and the AI's continued evolution.</p>
