    <h1>Turtle Drone (SD-12)</h1>
    <h2>Nickname</h2>
    <p>Turtle Drone</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Turtle Drone (SD-12) is a highly advanced, multi-role swarm unit designed to operate autonomously or as part of a coordinated collective. Initially developed for high-risk military and industrial applications, its versatility has made it indispensable for protection, offense, and resource support in hazardous environments. The nickname “Turtle Drone” stems from its carapace-like shell, which serves both defensive and offensive functions.</p>

    <h2>Capabilities</h2>
    <h3>Carapace Shield</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Made from an advanced composite material resistant to ballistic and energy-based impacts.</li>
        <li>Sharpened edges allow the drone to act as a high-speed slicing weapon.</li>
        <li>Features active camouflage, enabling the drone to blend seamlessly with its surroundings.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Swarm Coordination</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Operates in cohesive units to protect larger assets or overwhelm targets.</li>
        <li>Capable of forming interlocking "blankets" to shield critical units or areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Dissipation Mechanism:</strong> The interconnected swarm distributes impact forces across multiple drones, significantly reducing localized damage. Flexible connections allow the swarm to absorb and redirect kinetic energy, enhancing durability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Offensive Functions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Individually, drones can act as high-speed projectiles, using their sharp edges to slice into targets.</li>
        <li>In swarm mode, they can coordinate attacks to disable or destroy larger threats with precision.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mobility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Equipped with advanced rotors for high-speed flight and rapid maneuvering.</li>
        <li>Capable of adapting to diverse environments, from urban landscapes to open combat zones.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Autonomy and AI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each unit is AI-guided, capable of independent decision-making or acting as part of a collective intelligence.</li>
        <li>Advanced environmental scanning and target tracking sensors enable high levels of situational awareness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History and Development</h2>
    <p>The Turtle Drone was conceived as a support unit for dangerous military operations where human or larger robotic presence was impractical. Early prototypes lacked the carapace’s hardened edge and camouflage capabilities, initially designed as resource retrieval units. Over time, the design was adapted to include advanced defensive and offensive features to meet the needs of high-conflict zones.</p>
    <p>Notable deployments in urban defense and industrial sabotage missions have demonstrated the Turtle Drone’s adaptability and effectiveness. In many cases, its swarm mode has proven decisive in protecting vital assets or neutralizing entrenched enemies.</p>
