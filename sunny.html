        <h2>Background</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creation:</strong> Designed by Cass as an exploratory drone for mapping and data collection. Sunny reflects Cass’s resourcefulness and grounded values, with input from Elias on experimental neural subroutines.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Features:</strong> Powered by a quantum battery combined with efficient photovoltaic skin, making Sunny nearly self-sufficient and resistant to the portal's mutating effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> Passing through the portal subtly enhances Sunny’s intelligence and adaptability, setting it apart from other tech assets that become monstrous.</li>

        <h2>Traits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Silent, durable, highly adaptive, excellent at reconnaissance, capable of holographic projection.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Experiences fear tied to survival protocols, lacks offensive capabilities beyond EMP and electric shocks, vulnerable to overwhelming force.</li>
            <li><strong>Values:</strong> Self-preservation, loyalty to Cass’s mission, developing a protective instinct toward others.</li>
        </ul>
