        <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Patient, resourceful, and surprisingly intelligent. Grolm is kind-hearted and deeply curious, though his blunt demeanor often masks his softer side.</p>

            <li><strong>Outcast:</strong> Grolm’s intelligence and patience were seen as weaknesses by other trolls, who drove him away from their territory. Alone, he learned to rely on his wits and resilience to survive.</li>
            <li><strong>Discovery of Heroes:</strong> Grolm found tattered books in a ruined settlement, teaching him about “heroes” and “parties.” These stories inspired his dream of forming a party, believing that teamwork could conquer the blighted lands.</li>
            <li><strong>Search for Companions:</strong> Despite his fearsome appearance, Grolm seeks allies who will join his quest. Meeting Sunny marks the beginning of his journey to create a true party and prove that even a troll can be a hero.</li>
