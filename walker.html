    <h1>Energy Generator (Walker)</h1>
    <p><strong>Designation:</strong> EG-Series (Energy Generators)</p>
    <p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Walker</p>
    
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Portable power stations designed to supply energy to remote or inaccessible sites. Equipped with locomotion to move autonomously across rugged terrain, reducing the need for transport bots.</p>
    
    <h2>Capabilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Locomotion:</strong> Four-legged walkers with a low, stable profile for climbing rocky or uneven surfaces. AI-assisted pathfinding for obstacle navigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Production:</strong> Fusion or quantum battery technology for continuous power generation. Output connectors for various voltage requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Toughness:</strong> Reinforced casing to protect sensitive components from harsh environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Networked AI for real-time coordination with other assets and centralized control.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Size and Appearance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Height:</strong> Approximately eight feet tall when walking, with extendable pylons for stabilization when stationary.</li>
        <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> A squat, robust design with a glowing energy core visible through a protective casing.</li>
        <li><strong>Colors:</strong> Standard corporate black with hazard yellow highlights.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>History of Development</h2>
    <p>Originally designed for remote mining sites and asteroid bases, the EG-Series was adapted for planetary exploration. Early prototypes lacked locomotion, requiring manual transport, but the addition of autonomous mobility significantly increased deployment efficiency.</p>
