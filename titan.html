    <p><strong>Designation:</strong> AX-100 (Autonomous Exo-Suit Model 100)</p>
    <p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Titan Suit</p>
    
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Designed as a multi-role autonomous exo-suit, the AX-100 excels in heavy-duty industrial operations and high-risk military applications. It serves as the foundation for multiple specialized variants.</p>
    
    <h2>Capabilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength and Durability:</strong> Capable of lifting several tons and withstanding extreme environmental conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Precision:</strong> Advanced AI ensures precise operation and adaptation to dynamic tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Tools:</strong> Equipped with modular attachments for a variety of operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> Compact fusion core with solar-assisted recharging for prolonged field deployment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Size and Appearance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Height:</strong> Approximately fifteen feet tall.</li>
        <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Bulky yet streamlined, with reinforced hydraulic limbs and glowing energy cores.</li>
        <li><strong>Colors:</strong> Standard corporate scheme (black with metallic accents).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>History of Development</h2>
    <p>Originally developed for asteroid mining and extreme construction, the AX-100 was adapted for military use after its success in industrial operations. It has been deployed in hazardous environments, including subzero, high-radiation, and high-pressure zones.</p>
    
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AX-100M (Military Variant):</strong> Features heavy weaponry, such as shoulder-mounted cannons and missile systems. Enhanced armor plating for battlefield durability.</li>
        <li><strong>AX-100I (Industrial Variant):</strong> Equipped with heavy drills, plasma cutters, and grappling hooks for mining and construction.</li>
        <li><strong>AX-100R (Rescue Variant):</strong> Includes reinforced gripping tools and sensors for locating survivors in disaster zones. Specialized shielding for high-heat and debris-filled environments.</li>
        <li><strong>AX-100A (Advanced Variant):</strong> Cutting-edge AI for complex tasks requiring high-level decision-making. Experimental stealth capabilities for covert operations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Potential Weaknesses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Slower movement compared to lighter units.</li>
        <li>High power consumption during intensive operations.</li>
        <li>Vulnerable to electromagnetic interference or hacking attempts.</li>
    </ul>
