        <h1>Tech World</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Tech World is dominated by mega-corporations, with Aeternum Industries at the forefront.</li>
            <li>Corporations act as governments, controlling resources, policy, and innovation.</li>
            <li>Citizens are divided between corporate elites and lower-class workers reliant on automation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mission to the Medieval World</h2>
        <p>Aeternum Industries discovered a planet 2.5 light-years away, showing an unexplained energy signature that intrigued scientists and motivated a mission.</p>
        <p>The mission aimed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Study the anomaly (later revealed to be tied to magic).</li>
            <li>Test new portal technology off-world to reduce risks to the home planet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ship carried:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An experimental portal powered by quantum entanglement.</li>
            <li>A nuclear-powered antimatter drive for interstellar travel.</li>
            <li>Two segments: a drive section and a landing section.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Catastrophic Failure</h2>
        <p>The ship broke apart due to mechanical failure during separation, with the drive section flung uncontrollably toward the planet.</p>
        <p>The drive section impact caused:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A massive nuclear explosion from its reactors.</li>
            <li>An antimatter explosion, flattening the surrounding area for hundreds of miles.</li>
            <li>A global nuclear winter lasting a decade, devastating the Medieval World’s civilizations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The landing section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Landed relatively intact near the impact site despite damage.</li>
            <li>Activated the portal, connecting the Medieval World to the Tech World.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Portal</h2>
        <p>The portal was damaged and malfunctioned, influenced by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Radiation from the explosions.</li>
            <li>The Medieval World’s magic field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Effects of the malfunction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Duplication of anything sent through, with a ratio of 1 item = 10 duplicates.</li>
            <li>Fusion of tech with biological mass and magic, creating grotesque monsters.</li>
            <li>Twisting of AI into hyper-intelligent yet feral entities, and human minds into feral monstrosities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Corporation Understanding</h2>
        <p>The Tech World is unaware of the portal’s malfunctions, interpreting the monsters as native life.</p>
        <p>Initial data sent back from the Medieval World showed signs of destruction and strange creatures, but the damaged sensors provided incomplete information.</p>
        <p>The corporation continues to send tech and resources through the portal, unknowingly contributing to the monster infestation.</p>
