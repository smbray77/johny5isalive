    <h1>Tech World</h1>
    <p>This is the hub for all things technological in our story.</p>

    <Tech World Overview
Society and Structure
The Tech World is dominated by mega-corporations, with Aeternum Industries at the forefront.
Corporations act as governments, controlling resources, policy, and innovation.
Citizens are divided between corporate elites and lower-class workers reliant on automation.

Mission to the Medieval World
Aeternum Industries discovered a planet 2.5 light-years away, showing an unexplained energy signature that intrigued scientists and motivated a mission.
The mission aimed to:
Study the anomaly (later revealed to be tied to magic).
Test new portal technology off-world to reduce risks to the home planet.
The ship carried:
An experimental portal powered by quantum entanglement.
A nuclear-powered antimatter drive for interstellar travel.
Two segments: a drive section and a landing section.

Catastrophic Failure
The ship broke apart due to mechanical failure during separation, with the drive section flung uncontrollably toward the planet.
The drive section impact caused:
A massive nuclear explosion from its reactors.
An antimatter explosion, flattening the surrounding area for hundreds of miles.
A global nuclear winter lasting a decade, devastating the Medieval World’s civilizations.
The landing section:
Landed relatively intact near the impact site despite damage.
Activated the portal, connecting the Medieval World to the Tech World.

The Portal
The portal was damaged and malfunctioned, influenced by:
Radiation from the explosions.
The Medieval World’s magic field.
Effects of the malfunction:
Duplication of anything sent through, with a ratio of 1 item = 10 duplicates.
Fusion of tech with biological mass and magic, creating grotesque monsters.
Twisting of AI into hyper-intelligent yet feral entities, and human minds into feral monstrosities.

Current Corporation Understanding
The Tech World is unaware of the portal’s malfunctions, interpreting the monsters as native life.
Initial data sent back from the Medieval World showed signs of destruction and strange creatures, but the damaged sensors provided incomplete information.
The corporation continues to send tech and resources through the portal, unknowingly contributing to the monster infestation.>
