        <h1>Expedition PX-237</h1>

        <h2>Mission Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Expedition PX-237 was initiated to investigate unexplained energy signatures on a newly discovered planet, evaluate potential resources, and test interdimensional portal technology.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Goals:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze and secure the unknown energy source for potential exploitation.</li>
                <li>Map the terrain and establish a foothold for future operations.</li>
                <li>Evaluate the long-term potential of PX-237 for resource extraction and corporate expansion.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Planning and Execution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-Mission Concerns:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Corporate prioritization of profit led to cutting corners in safety and materials.</li>
                <li>Warnings about the ship’s design and rushed development were dismissed.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Crew Hierarchy:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Upper Class: Corporate overseers and project leads.</li>
                <li>Middle Class: Scientists, engineers, and AI technicians.</li>
                <li>Lower Class: Maintenance workers and expendable personnel.</li>
                <li>Class divides caused internal tension during the mission.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Vessel Design:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Drive Section: Nuclear-powered antimatter engine for propulsion.</li>
                <li>Landing Section: Equipped for planetary landing, exploration, and portal deployment.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Catastrophic Separation:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Faulty explosive bolts caused incomplete separation of the ship's sections.</li>
                <li>The drive section was flung toward the planet, resulting in a nuclear explosion followed by an antimatter detonation.</li>
                <li>The landing section, though damaged, continued its programmed descent and activated the portal.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Portal Malfunction and Consequences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial Issues:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>PX-237’s magic field and radiation influenced the portal, causing severe malfunctions.</li>
                <li>Early anomalies included duplication, fusion of tech and biological mass, and corrupted data.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Unintended Results:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Assets sent through the portal became grotesque hybrids, later known as Unknown Monsters (UM).</li>
                <li>Aeternum HQ misinterpreted these monsters as native lifeforms, failing to connect them to their own technology.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>At-Home Portal Operations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Preparation:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Extensive testing of portal technology in controlled environments before deployment.</li>
                <li>Calibration for PX-237’s conditions using limited data from the landing section.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Asset Deployment Plan:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial assets focused on reconnaissance and infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Later deployments included security measures and experimental technology.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Deployment Philosophy:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>A phased approach prioritized caution but quickly escalated as confidence in the portal grew.</li>
                <li>Early anomalies and duplication errors were dismissed as minor.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
