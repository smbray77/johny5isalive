<h2>Chapter 3: Cleansing the Aftermath and Unlikely Connections</h2>

<h3>Scene 1: The Purifiers’ Grim Task</h3>
<p>The battlefield is strewn with remnants of the recent conflict. The UMs have devoured all bodies, leaving behind only fragments of armor and shattered weapons. Cocoons pulse faintly, ominously scattered across the field.</p>
<p>Kaelen Drakethorn, a seasoned purifier, leads his team as they methodically incinerate the cocoons using their enchanted fire gauntlets. Nearby, scouts keep watch for approaching UMs, ready to signal retreat to the safety of the magical barrier. Kaelen reflects on the grim realities of his work, contemplating his limited future as a purifier due to inevitable blight exposure.</p>
<p>Flashbacks reveal Kaelen’s rigorous training, the purifier’s emphasis on survival over heroics, and the harsh truth that every purifier’s time is finite. Despite this, Kaelen dreams of being more than “clean-up,” yearning to make a greater impact in the fight against the UMs.</p>

<p>Grolm reveals his fascination with heroes and adventurers, admitting that he saved her because he dreams of forming his own party.

As they talk, a bond begins to form, with Elyndra slowly recognizing Grolm’s sincerity and determination.</p>
<p>The scene closes with Grolm expressing his hope that Elyndra might become the first member of his party, leaving her both unsettled and intrigued.</p>
