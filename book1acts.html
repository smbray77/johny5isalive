        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opening Scene: The Team’s Sacrifice</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A renowned adventuring party battles UMs near the edge of the wasteland, knowing their mission is to stall the horde and buy time for the army and mages to prepare.</li>
                    <li>The fight demonstrates:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What Works:</strong> Fire-based magic, piercing weapons, and teamwork.</li>
                            <li><strong>What Fails:</strong> Brute strength, sustained spells vulnerable to disruption.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The UMs exhibit coordinated tactics, a new and disturbing behavior suggesting they are being led by something or someone.</li>
                    <li>Despite their best efforts, the party is overwhelmed. The healer, known as one of the best frontline healers in the realm, narrowly escapes, gravely injured.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Evacuation and Military Response</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The scene shifts to a small town south of the breached wall, where chaos reigns as civilians evacuate, and soldiers and mages scramble to defend the breach.</li>
                    <li>Commanders note the unusual cooperation of the UMs, raising concerns about their intelligence and strategy.</li>
                    <li>Scouts report the incoming wave of UMs, introducing the “workhorse” types:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fast and agile attackers.</li>
                            <li>Massive, tank-like creatures smashing through barriers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mages work desperately to erect a temporary magical barrier to plug the breach, while the soldiers hold the line.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Temporary Barrier and Retreat</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mages complete the magical barrier after heavy losses, draining their strength significantly.</li>
                    <li>The army is forced to retreat, leaving behind injured and fallen soldiers.</li>
                    <li>Soldiers watch in horror as the UMs consume everything outside the barrier, dead or alive.</li>
                    <li>The magical barrier will require constant mage rotations until the physical wall is rebuilt and permanently enchanted.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Grolm’s Perspective</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grolm observes the battle and evacuation from the foothills of the mountains, struggling with whether to intervene.</li>
                    <li>Fearing humans will mistake him for a threat, he hesitates but is drawn to the healer’s desperate efforts.</li>
                    <li>After the UMs kill the remaining adventurers and move toward the breach, Grolm descends and kills three smaller UMs consuming the fallen party members.</li>
                    <li>He rescues the healer, who is near death and emotionally shattered by the loss of her team.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Aftermath</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grolm carries the injured healer to safety, cradling her as she succumbs to her injuries and faints.</li>
                    <li>The chapter ends with:
                        <ul>
                            <li>An ominous remark from the army commander about the growing threat of the UMs.</li>
                            <li>A cinematic scene of Grolm retreating to the mountains, carrying the unconscious healer, framed by smoke and the distant cries of the town.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
