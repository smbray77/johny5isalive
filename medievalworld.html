        <h1>Medieval World Overview</h1>
        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>
            The story is set approximately <strong>20 years after the meteor strike</strong>, which brought devastation and lasting changes to the world. 
            The <strong>nuclear winter</strong> caused by the meteor lasted <strong>5 to 8 years</strong>, leading to widespread famine, societal collapse, and environmental shifts.
        </p>

        <h2>The Meteor Event</h2>
        <p>
            Known to the medieval world as the <strong>Falling Star</strong> or the <strong>Worldbreaker</strong>, the meteor struck with catastrophic force, 
            killing half the population and shattering the foundations of major kingdoms. The impact created a <strong>blight</strong>, a mysterious and deadly sickness, 
            and tore open a <strong>rift</strong> to the unknown, releasing strange creatures and otherworldly phenomena.
        </p>

        <h2>Survival and Society</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Population Displacement:</strong> Survivors retreated to underground bunkers, mountain strongholds, and less affected regions, forming fragmented communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Wasteland Struggle:</strong> The areas near the impact site are uninhabitable, marked by poisoned land, dead forests, and craters.</li>
            <li><strong>Rebuilding Efforts:</strong> Survivors focus on small-scale agriculture, barter economies, and local defense. Centralized governments have collapsed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Blight</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A slow, creeping sickness believed to emanate from the meteor’s crash site, causing fatigue, wasting, and death.</li>
            <li>Survivors use <strong>magic-infused crystals</strong> to detect and mitigate the blight, which has also mutated animals and plants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Crystals</h2>
        <p>
            The crystals are a mix of the planet’s inherent magic and the shocked, crystallized ground from the meteor’s explosions. Survivors first noticed their unique properties 
            when the crystals glowed less and less the farther they were taken from the blight lands.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unaltered Crystals:</strong> Used as indicators of radiation or blight levels, glowing brighter in areas with higher blight.</li>
            <li><strong>Enchanted Crystals:</strong> Magic users can infuse the crystals, enabling communication between distant settlements or individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Blight Diagnosis:</strong> Experimentation led to the development of a scale for measuring blight exposure in areas and individuals. Magic-infused crystals 
                can diagnose the blight in a person and determine if they have crossed the <strong>"dead line"</strong>, where no recovery is possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Monsters (UM)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Known as the <strong>UM (Unknown Monsters)</strong>, a name that stuck because of their mysterious nature.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Half-biological, half-machine creatures twisted by the portal’s effects. They cannot reproduce traditionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Doubling Mechanism:</strong> Upon death, UM form <strong>cocoons</strong> that hatch into two new monsters unless their water sacks are destroyed before death. 
                Even then, <strong>wasteland purifiers</strong> must burn the cocoons to prevent them from hatching if exposed to water.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wasteland Purifiers</h2>
        <p>
            Wasteland purifiers are individuals tasked with destroying cocoons and combating the blight. They are granted priority access to crystals, which 
            allow them to detect the presence and severity of the blight in their surroundings. Their work is dangerous but essential to survival.
        </p>

        <h2>Cultural Shifts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legends and Beliefs:</strong> The meteor is seen as a divine or infernal event, while the monsters are regarded as trials sent by the gods.</li>
            <li><strong>New Traditions:</strong> Magic users, crystal harvesters, and wasteland purifiers are celebrated as heroes in surviving communities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Survival and Adaptation:</strong> The medieval world is defined by its struggle to adapt to the new reality brought by the meteor.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural vs. Supernatural:</strong> The interplay between natural disasters, magic, and supernatural monsters creates tension and mystery.</li>
            <li><strong>Rebirth Amid Chaos:</strong> Despite the devastation, hints of renewal and hope persist as survivors rebuild and adapt.</li>
        </ul>
