    <h1>Dr. Elias Marovian</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Antagonist</p>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Dr. Elias Marovian was once a brilliant and idealistic scientist in Aeternum Industries, heading the asset development division. He was responsible for creating and managing many of the corporation's advanced assets, including neural interfaces used to control them. Despite his intelligence, Elias was often overlooked for promotions and recognition due to his lack of "corporate charisma" and assertiveness, leading to resentment and a sense of alienation.</p>
    <p><strong>The Catalyst:</strong> In an attempt to prove himself, Elias secretly used the experimental portal to travel to PX-237, hoping to make groundbreaking discoveries. However, the portal's malfunction twisted his body and mind, fusing him with his neural control device and granting him psychic abilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Post-Transformation:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Elias developed god-like control over the Unknown Monsters (UMs).</li>
            <li>His vast intellect became even more formidable, making him a terrifying strategist.</li>
            <li>His physical form became a horrifying mix of organic and machine, with the neural control device embedded in his chest or head, glowing when he exerts control.</li>
            <li>The portal's magic granted him abilities akin to sorcery, such as manipulating the blight and twisting his environment.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Elias sees himself as a savior of PX-237, believing he's creating a "perfect" world free from the flaws of corporate greed and incompetence. However, his delusion and growing malice have turned him into a monstrous overlord.</p>
    <p><strong>Connection to Protagonists:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tech World Protagonist:</strong> A former colleague who uncovers Elias’s betrayal and transformation, making his downfall personal.</li>
            <li><strong>Medieval World Protagonist:</strong> Sees Elias as a god-like figure of destruction, eventually learning of his human origins.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Protagonist:</strong> Possibly created by Elias in his earlier, idealistic days, the AI’s resistance to corruption mirrors Elias’s fall.</li>
        </ul>
