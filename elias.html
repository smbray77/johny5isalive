        <h2>Background</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Humble Beginnings:</strong> 
                Elias grew up in a middle-class household, showing a natural aptitude for science and engineering from an early age. He was driven by a desire to prove himself and create groundbreaking technology that could change the world.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Education and Friendship with Casey:</strong> 
                Elias attended the same university as Casey, where they collaborated on projects that combined his visionary ideas with her practical solutions. Late-night brainstorming sessions and a shared drive for innovation built a strong friendship that lasted even as their careers diverged.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Career at Aeternum Industries:</strong> 
                Elias quickly rose through the ranks of Aeternum, earning his own R&D division. While his charisma and ambition won him accolades, he grew frustrated with corporate bureaucracy and his lack of recognition compared to less innovative peers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Descent into Obsession:</strong> 
                Frustrated and resentful, Elias became increasingly secretive, seeing the portal as his chance to prove his brilliance. His obsession with its potential led to dangerous experiments and ultimately his catastrophic transformation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Traits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Visionary thinker, charismatic leader, unmatched technical expertise, resourceful.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Overly ambitious, secretive, prone to tunnel vision, driven by resentment.</li>
            <li><strong>Values:</strong> Innovation and achievement, but his values become warped by his need for recognition and control.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Key Role in Story</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> 
                Using the portal transformed Elias, fusing him with his neural control device and granting him psychic abilities. He reshapes PX-237 into a blighted kingdom under his control, using his intellect and powers to dominate the Unknown Monsters.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ideology:</strong> 
                Elias sees himself as a savior, creating a "perfect" world free from corporate greed and incompetence. However, his vision is twisted, and his actions bring destruction and despair.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Relationship with Casey:</strong> 
                Their friendship adds emotional depth, as Casey struggles to reconcile the friend she knew with the antagonist he has become.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Connection to Sunny:</strong> 
                Elias’s early input on the AI protagonist’s neural subroutines indirectly contributes to its evolution, creating a subtle thematic link between his own transformation and Sunny’s growth.
