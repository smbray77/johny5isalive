                Elias attended the same university as Casey "Cass" Miller, where they bonded over shared frustrations with corporate systems and a mutual passion for innovation. He was the visionary, full of bold ideas, while Casey often balanced him with her practicality. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Career at Aeternum Industries:</strong> After graduation, Elias quickly climbed the corporate ladder, earning his own R&D division due to his ambitious projects and charismatic leadership. Despite their diverging career paths, he and Casey remained friends, regularly exchanging ideas and insights.</li>

        <h2>Traits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Visionary thinker, charismatic leader, unmatched technical expertise, resourceful.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Overly ambitious, secretive, prone to tunnel vision, driven by resentment.</li>

            Elias serves as the central antagonist, using his intellect and psychic abilities to reshape PX-237 into a blighted kingdom under his control. His relationship with Casey adds emotional depth, as she struggles to reconcile the ambitious friend she once knew with the monstrous figure he becomes. Elias views himself as a savior, believing his actions will create a "perfect" world free from corporate greed, but his descent into madness makes him a formidable and tragic villain.
